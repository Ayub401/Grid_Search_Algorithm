# Grid_Search_Algorithm
This is an algorithm which used in find the best hyper parameter. In this repository, you will find its implementation from scratch.
The code is added with a lot of comments which will help you understand the code easily.

# basic understanding of hyper parameter in machine learning and how it will tuned using Grid Search Algorithm
Hyperparameters are parameters whose values control the learning process and determine the values of model parameters that a learning algorithm ends up learning. The prefix ‘hyper_’ suggests that they are ‘top-level’ parameters that control the learning process and the model parameters that result from it.
